terraria-tool

This is a simple tool to parse Terraria world files.

*It does not yet support Terraria 1.1 files!*

To use, simply type:

sbt "run <path-to-world-file> <action>"

Have lots of heap space available.

Only two actions are supported right now: 

 - stats <default action>: shows some information about the world, such as what is in the chests, and what NPCs are wandering around your world
 - map: dumps an ASCII map of the world
